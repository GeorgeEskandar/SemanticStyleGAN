directions to look at : from linear interp. extracted from weights of Car's shape LG

1-> minimizes mid car and does not affect sides that much ?
3-> decrease all increase right side ?
4-> increase all 

rexplore: 6 


bilinear:

0 - > increase side car on the right more than on the left
2 - > increasecars on the right ?
5 - > decrease side cars increase mid car.
7 - > decrease all increase mid car 


__________________________

interleaved:

0-> Best increase cars on the right.
3 -> more side cars
5 - > increase  for cars on left side 
7-> is interesting. 1 side increase on the left while the other direction increase both sides. (controls mainly cars on the right.)
9,1,2-> Nolthing major


There are directions in textures that increases shadows, increases rocky road texture, lighting and other stuff



Trees:

2-> from right to mid and left 
5-> too many trees to 1 tree in mid 

roads :
PCA 0 -> Decrease from left
PCA 2 - >Swerve road to right ?
PCA 6-> enlarge road

Sefa results on seperated layers:
 Layer 2 : dir 4: greater amount of cars
 Layer 3 : dir 1: increase mid car in a dir, then increase right/left drastically
 Layer 4: dir 0 : Quite good for overall car closeups dir3: good mid and left side car increase
 Layer 5: dir0: decent increase on left(from right to left) ... dir 2: good increase on left ... dir5: increase on right decreaes on left

PCA results on seperated layers :
Layer2: dir found to increase car on left// but not worth while
Layer 4: dir1: good increase/decrease left without affecting mid
Layer 5: dir1: good increase of cars on right . Dir 2: good increase of cars on left, maybe 5 good increase on left while mid static

Other directions while exploring top 10 normal PCA directions :

    With vegitation:
    direction 8 is best for overall increase

    road+sw:
    dir 2 : increase right side walk/ decrease road
    dir 6: strong decrease road increase side walk. ( 7 is similar too)
    dir 8: sw in middle of street:

    build+sky+trees:
    dir 3 : build+sky vs trees.
    dir 8 : much better effect for that. which proves that directions for dominant classes has more effect
            when edited all at once.


Sefa on all shape layers for car again:  {-20,20,35}
    dir 6: decreases side cars / increase side cars
    dir 7: increase/ decrease cars on the left
    conclusion : You need to look again at the new changes introduced in this range for sefa.

next step: 1)Identify meaningful directions for various classes and combine them.
           2)Principal components on textures of trees/cars/road/building

layer 8 : 
dir0: Softens dark textures.( Remove road markings)
dir4: Increase road markings

layer 7:
dir 0 : more road markings too

For Trees Textures :

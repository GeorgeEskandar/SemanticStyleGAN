directions to look at : from linear interp. extracted from weights of Car's shape LG

1-> minimizes mid car and does not affect sides that much ?
3-> decrease all increase right side ?
4-> increase all 

rexplore: 6 


bilinear:

0 - > increase side car on the right more than on the left
2 - > increasecars on the right ?
5 - > decrease side cars increase mid car.
7 - > decrease all increase mid car 


__________________________

interleaved:

0-> Best increase cars on the right.
3 -> more side cars
5 - > increase  for cars on left side 
7-> is interesting. 1 side increase on the left while the other direction increase both sides. (controls mainly cars on the right.)
9,1,2-> Nolthing major


There are directions in textures that increases shadows, increases rocky road texture, lighting and other stuff



Trees:

2-> from right to mid and left 
5-> too many trees to 1 tree in mid 

roads :
PCA 0 -> Decrease from left
PCA 2 - >Swerve road to right ?
PCA 6-> enlarge road

Sefa results on seperated layers:
 Layer 2 : dir 4: greater amount of cars
 Layer 3 : dir 1: increase mid car in a dir, then increase right/left drastically
 Layer 4: dir 0 : Quite good for overall car closeups dir3: good mid and left side car increase
 Layer 5: dir0: decent increase on left(from right to left) ... dir 2: good increase on left ... dir5: increase on right decreaes on left

road:
5_0: left side inc/dec
9_0: darken road
9_2/9_5: Shadows on road.

PCA results on seperated layers :
Layer2: dir found to increase car on left// but not worth while
Layer 4: dir1: good increase/decrease sides/left without affecting mid dir2: good inc and decrease mid
Layer 5: dir1: good increase of cars on right . Dir 2: good increase of cars on left, maybe 5 good increase on left while mid static

Other directions while exploring top 10 normal PCA directions :

    With vegitation:
    direction 8 is best for overall increase

    road+sw:
    dir 2 : increase right side walk/ decrease road
    dir 6: strong decrease road increase side walk. ( 7 is similar too)
    dir 8: sw in middle of street:

    build+sky+trees:
    dir 3 : build+sky vs trees.
    dir 8 : much better effect for that. which proves that directions for dominant classes has more effect
            when edited all at once.


Sefa on all shape layers for car again:  {-20,20,35}
    dir 6: decreases side cars / increase side cars
    dir 7: increase/ decrease cars on the left
    conclusion : You need to look again at the new changes introduced in this range for sefa.

next step: 1)Identify meaningful directions for various classes and combine them.
           2)Principal components on textures of trees/cars/road/building

For Road/ PCA on S Space:
Layer 5:
    dir 6: Increase road size
    dir 7: Make road more narrow.

Layer 3:
dir0: Decent narrowing of road 

layer 9 :
dir0: Change road pavement ?
dir4: Darken road.
dir6: increase shadows.
dir 7 : Add strong road markings.

layer 8 :

Class car :
5_0: Cars inc and dec  ## Still left, increase the scale.
5_1; increase sider/ dec mid 
5_4: increase/decrease sides
4_2: left side inc/ right side and mid inc

9_3: turn cars black/ white

Class Sky:
5_1: inc/dec sky. same as 5_2 same as 5_4same as 4_1 ( good )
5_5: Affect right side of sky.


9_0: Brighten or darken sky.
9_7: Cloudy or clear skies (9_8: might be better) (8_1 good,)
..
newest: 
9_9: night and day ? or 9_6 


Class Vegi:
9_1: Removes leaves similar to 9_0 and 9_4 9_7 also interesting

Sky:
9_0: night to day
9_3/9_7/9_5/8_7: make it Cloudy
5_0: Drecrease sky 
4_2: decrease sky all sides.
